- To the "developers" like franciscofranco:
Are you able to work on your own?
Also, if you want to badly copy my commits, can you at least give credits
to the proprietary of the commit you're copying?

We're an opensource community, we do this for free... but we also are
satisfacted of the TIME WE LOSE on the things we do.
We want to work with everyone that wants to.
We publish our sources.
We give you all everything we do.


And you?




Instead of copying someone else's work, try to lose time on your own
at least sorting the not working commits (yeah, I knew someone was
copying my work and I've committed some fakes).


You did that badly.
